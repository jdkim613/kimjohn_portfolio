          <p class="body-style bottom-margin-18">I realized that I don't really care much about technology as much as I do about people. I love the connections we build with one another; the moments that we sit down and laugh together. Those are the moments I design for.</p>
          <p class="body-style bottom-margin-18">I believe inclusive designs are the principles that bring us closer to those that are different from us. Inclusion isn't just about race, gender, or wealthâ€“ it's also saying "hello" to new friends who are alone. I became a designer so that I can help solve these problems at scale and empower people who just need a little boost.</p>
